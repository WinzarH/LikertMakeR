Description: Synthesise rating-scale data with predefined 
  first & second moments (mean & standard deviation) and, optionally, 
  correlate multiple vectors with predefined  correlation matrix. 
  The function, `lexact()`, uses the 'DEoptim' 
  <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=DEoptim> package, described in 
  Mullen, Ardia, Gil, Windover, & Cline (2011) <doi:10.18637/jss.v040.i06>,
  to synthesise a vector of discrete values with predefined mean and 
  standard deviation exact to two decimal places, if feasible. 
  The function, `lfast()`, draws a random sample from a Beta distribution 
  which is rescaled to give a vector with approximate first and second moments. 
  It is much faster than `lexact()` but not as precise. 
  The function, `lcor()`, systematically swaps values within each column of a 
  data-frame so that they are correlated to fit a predefined correlation matrix.
