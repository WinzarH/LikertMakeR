**_LikertMakeR_** synthesises and correlates Likert-scale and related 
rating-scale data. 
You decide the mean and standard deviation, and (optionally) the correlations 
among vectors, and the package will generate data with those same predefined 
properties. 

The package generates a column of values that simulate the same properties 
as a rating scale. 
If multiple columns are generated, then you can use 
**_LikertMakeR_** to rearrange the values so that the new variables are 
correlated exactly in accord with a user-predefined correlation matrix.

## Purpose

The package should be useful for teaching in the Social Sciences, 
and for scholars who wish to "replicate" rating-scale data for further 
analysis and visualisation when only summary statistics have been reported. 

## Motivation

I was prompted to write the functions in _LikertMakeR_ after reviewing too 
many journal article submissions where authors presented questionnaire results 
with only means and standard deviations (often only the means), with no 
apparent understanding of scale distributions, and their impact on scale 
properties. 
Hopefully, this tool will help researchers, teachers, and other reviewers, 
to better think about rating-scale distributions, and the effects of variance, 
scale boundaries, and number of items in a scale.

## Rating scale properties

A Likert scale is the mean, or sum, of several ordinal rating scales. 
Typically, they are bipolar (usually "agree-disagree") responses to 
propositions that are determined to be moderately-to-highly correlated 
and that capture various facets of a theoretical construct.

Rating scales, such as Likert scales, are not continuous or unbounded.

For example, a 5-point Likert scale that is constructed with, say, five items 
(questions) will have a summed range of between 5 (all rated '1') and 25 
(all rated '5') with all integers in between, and the mean range will 
be '1' to '5' with intervals of 1/5=0.20. A 7-point Likert scale constructed 
from eight items will have a summed range between 8 (all rated '1') and 
56 (all rated '7') with all integers in between, and the mean range will 
be '1' to '7' with intervals of 1/8=0.125.

Rating-scale boundaries define minima and maxima for any scale values. 
If the mean is close to one boundary then data points will gather more 
closely to that boundary. 
If the mean is not in the middle of a scale, 
and if the standard deviation is any more than about 1/4 of the scale range, 
then the data will be always skewed.

## _LikertMakeR_ functions

 * _lfast()_ and _lfast_R()_ quickly generate a vector of values with 
 approximate predefined moments
 
 * _lexact()_ also generates a vector of values, but accurate to two 
 decimal places. _lfast_R()_ does this too, but more quickly, so 
 _lexact()_ remains as a legacy function.
 
 * _lcor()_ and _lcor_C()_ take a dataframe of rating-scale values and 
 rearranges the values in each column so that the columns are correlated 
 to match a predefined correlation matrix.
 
 * _makeCorrAlpha_ constructs a random correlation 
 matrix of given dimensions and predefined Cronbach's Alpha
 
 * _makeItems()_ is a wrapper function for _lfast_R()_ 
 and _lcor_C()_ to generate synthetic rating-scale data with predefined 
 first and second moments and a predefined correlation matrix
 
 * _alpha()_ calculates Cronbach's Alpha from a given 
 correlation matrix or a given dataframe
 
 * _eigenvalues()_ calculates eigenvalues of a correlation matrix, 
 reports on positive-definite status of the matrix and, optionally, 
 displays a scree plot to visualise the eigenvalues

## Generate synthetic rating-scale data

To synthesise a rating scale with **_LikertMakeR_**, the user must input 
the following parameters:

 - **_n_**: sample size

 - **_mean_**: desired mean

 - **_sd_**: desired standard deviation

 - **_lowerbound_**: desired lower bound

 - **_upperbound_**: desired upper bound

 - **_items_**: number of items making the scale - default = 1

 - **_seed_**: optional seed for reproducibility

**_LikertMakeR_** offers three functions for synthesising a 
rating scale: **_lfast()_** and **_lexact()_**, and a recent addition:
**_lfast_R()_**. _lfast_R()_ is likely to replace _lexact()_ in the next 
submission to CRAN.


____

### _lfast()_ and _lfast_R()_

- **_lfast()_** draws a random sample from a scaled *Beta* distribution. 
It is very fast but does not guarantee exact mean and standard deviation. 
Recommended for relatively large sample sizes. 

- **_lfast_R()_** draws repeated random samples from a scaled *Beta* 
distribution.
It is slightly slower than _lfast()_ but usually produces a vector with 
moments accurate to two decimal places.

#### _lfast()_ & _lfast_R()_ example

##### a four-item, five-point Likert scale

###### _lfast()_

```{r}

x1 <- lfast(
 n = 512,
 mean = 2.5,
 sd = 0.75,
 lowerbound = 1,
 upperbound = 5,
 items = 4
)
```



```{r fig1, fig.height=3, fig.width=4, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}

## distribution of x

hist(x1,
 cex.axis = 0.5, cex.main = 0.75,
 breaks = seq(from = 1, to = 5, by = 0.25),
 col = "sky blue", xlab = NULL, ylab = NULL,
 main = paste("mu=", round(mean(x1), 2), ", sd=", round(sd(x1), 2))
)
```


###### _lfast_R()_

```{r}

x2 <- lfast_R(
 n = 512,
 mean = 2.5,
 sd = 0.75,
 lowerbound = 1,
 upperbound = 5,
 items = 4
)
```



```{r fig2, fig.height=3, fig.width=4, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}

## distribution of x

hist(x2,
 cex.axis = 0.5, cex.main = 0.75,
 breaks = seq(from = 1, to = 5, by = 0.25),
 col = "sky blue", xlab = NULL, ylab = NULL,
 main = paste("mu=", round(mean(x2), 2), ", sd=", round(sd(x2), 2))
)
```



##### an 11-point likelihood-of-purchase scale

###### _lfast()_

```{r}

x3 <- lfast(256, 3, 2, 0, 10)
```


```{r fig3, fig.height=3, fig.width=4, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}

hist(x3,
 cex.axis = 0.5, cex.main = 0.75,
 breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 10, by = 1.0),
 col = "sky blue", xlab = NULL, ylab = NULL,
 main = paste("mu=", round(mean(x3), 2), ", sd=", round(sd(x3), 2))
)
```


###### _lfast_R()_


```{r}

x4 <- lfast_R(256, 3, 2, 0, 10)
```


```{r fig4, fig.height=3, fig.width=4, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}

hist(x4,
 cex.axis = 0.5, cex.main = 0.75,
 breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 10, by = 1.0),
 col = "sky blue", xlab = NULL, ylab = NULL,
 main = paste("mu=", round(mean(x4), 2), ", sd=", round(sd(x4), 2))
)
```


____

### _lexact()_

**_lexact()_** attempts to produce a vector with exact first and 
 second moments. 

If feasible, **_lexact()_** should produce data with moments that are 
correct to two decimal places. 
Infeasible cases occur when the requested standard deviation is too 
large for the combination of mean, n-items, and scale boundaries.

The optimisation process means that the function is considerably slower than 
**_lfast()_** or than **_lfast_R()_**: taking exponentially more time with 
the number of items, and linearly more time with the sample size.

_lexact()_ uses the *Differential Evolution* algorithm in the 
**_[DEoptim](https://cran.r-project.org/package=DEoptim)_** 
package to find appropriate values within the desired constraints. 
The [DEoptim](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=DEoptim) package is described 
in Mullen, Ardia, Gil, Windover, & Cline (2011) <doi:10.18637/jss.v040.i06>.

#### _lexact()_ example #1

##### a four-item, five-point Likert scale

```{r}

x <- lexact(
 n = 64,
 mean = 2.5,
 sd = 0.75,
 lowerbound = 1,
 upperbound = 5,
 items = 4
)
```


```{r fig5, fig.height=3, fig.width=4, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}

hist(x,
 cex.axis = 0.5, cex.main = 0.75,
 breaks = seq(from = 1, to = 5, by = 0.25),
 col = "sky blue", xlab = NULL, ylab = NULL,
 main = paste("mean=", round(mean(x), 2), ", sd=", round(sd(x), 2))
)
```

#### _lexact()_ example #2

##### 11-point likelihood-of-purchase scale

```{r}

x <- lexact(64, 3, 2, 0, 10)
```


```{r fig6, fig.height=3, fig.width=4, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}

hist(x,
 cex.axis = 0.5, cex.main = 0.75,
 breaks = c(0:10),
 col = "sky blue",
 xlab = NULL, ylab = NULL,
 main = paste("mu=", round(mean(x), 2), ", sd=", round(sd(x), 2))
)
```

## Correlating rating scales

**_LikertMakeR_** offers another function, **_lcor()_**, 
which rearranges the values in the columns of a data-set so that 
they are correlated at a specified level. It does not change the 
values - it swaps their positions within each column so that 
univariate statistics do not change, but their correlations with 
other vectors do.

### _lcor()_ and _lcor_C()_

**_lcor()_** systematically selects pairs of values in a column 
and swaps their places, and checks to see if this swap improves 
the correlation matrix. If the revised data-frame produces a 
correlation matrix closer to the target correlation matrix, 
then the swap is retained. 
Otherwise, the values are returned to their original places. 
This process is iterated across each column. 

**_lcor_C()_** is an implementation of _lcor()_ written in C++ 
it is here as a trial ahead of replacing _lcor()_ in the near future. 
It is much faster!

To create the desired correlated data, the user must define the 
following parameters:

- **_data_**: a starter data set of rating-scales

- **_target_**: the target correlation matrix

### _lcor()_ example

Let's generate some data: three 5-point Likert scales, 
each with five items.

```{r }

## generate uncorrelated synthetic data

n <- 128
lowerbound <- 1
upperbound <- 5
items <- 5

mydat3 <- data.frame(
 x1 = lfast_R(n, 2.5, 0.75, lowerbound, upperbound, items),
 x2 = lfast_R(n, 3.0, 1.50, lowerbound, upperbound, items),
 x3 = lfast_R(n, 3.5, 1.00, lowerbound, upperbound, items)
)
```

The first six observations from this data-frame are:

```{r, echo = FALSE}

head(mydat3, 6)

```

And the first and second moments (to 3 decimal places) are:

```{r, echo = FALSE}

moments <- data.frame(
 mean = apply(mydat3, 2, mean) |> round(3),
 sd = apply(mydat3, 2, sd) |> round(3)
)

t(moments)
```

We can see that the data have first and second moments very close 
to what is expected. 

The synthetic data have low correlations:

```{r, echo = FALSE}

cor(mydat3) |> round(3)
```



```{r}

## describe a target correlation matrix

tgt3 <- matrix(
 c(
 1.00, 0.85, 0.75,
 0.85, 1.00, 0.65,
 0.75, 0.65, 1.00
 ),
 nrow = 3
)
```

So now we have a data-frame with desired first and second moments, 
and a target correlation matrix.

```{r}

## apply lcor() function

new3 <- lcor(mydat3, tgt3)
```

The first column of the new data-frame will not change, but values of the 
other columns are rearranged. 

The first six observations from this data-frame are:

```{r, echo = FALSE}

head(new3, 6)
```

And the new data frame is correlated close to our desired correlation matrix; here presented to 3 decimal places:

```{r, echo = FALSE}

cor(new3) |> round(3)
```


```{r}

## apply lcor_C function

new3C <- lcor_C(mydat3, tgt3)
```

**_lcor_C()_** should run more quickly than _lcor()_, with the same output: 

```{r, echo = FALSE}

cor(new3C) |> round(3)
```


## Generate a correlation matrix from Cronbach's Alpha

### makeCorrAlpha()

**_makeCorrAlpha()_**, constructs a random correlation matrix of given 
 dimensions and predefined Cronbach's Alpha. 
 
To create the desired correlation matrix, the user must define the 
following parameters:

- **_items_**: or "k" - the number of rows and columns of the 
 desired correlation matrix. 

- **_alpha_**: the target value for Cronbach's Alpha

- **_variance_**: a notional variance coefficient to affect the spread of 
values in the correlation matrix. Default = '0.5'. 
A value of '0' produces a matrix where all off-diagonal correlations 
are equal. 
Setting 'variance = 1.0' gives a wider range of values. 


Random values generated by _makeCorrAlpha()_ are highly volatile.
 _makeCorrAlpha()_ may not generate a feasible (positive-definite)
 correlation matrix, especially when

 * variance is high relative to
 
     - desired Alpha, and
 
     - desired correlation dimensions

_makeCorrAlpha()_ will inform the user if the resulting correlation
 matrix is positive definite, or not.

If the returned correlation matrix is not positive-definite, 
because solutions are so volatile, 
a feasible solution may be still possible, and often is. 
The user is encouraged to try again, possibly several times, to find one.

### _makeCorrAlpha()_ examples

#### four variables, Alpha = 0.85

```{r}

## define parameters 

 items <- 4
 alpha <- 0.85
 variance <- 0.5

## apply makeCorrAlpha() function

 set.seed(42)
 
 cor_matrix_4 <- makeCorrAlpha(items, alpha, variance)
```


#### test output with Helper functions

Cronbach's Alpha for the generated correlation matrix is:

```{r}

## using helper function alpha()

 alpha(cor_matrix_4)
```

And the correlation matrix is positive-definite:

```{r fig7, fig.height=4, fig.width=5, fig.align='center', echo = TRUE}
 
## using helper function eigenvalues() 

eigenvalues(cor_matrix_4, 1)
```


#### twelve variables, alpha = 0.90, variance = 1

```{r}

## define parameters 

 items <- 12
 alpha <- 0.90
 variance <- 1.0

 
## apply makeCorrAlpha() function

 set.seed(42) 

 cor_matrix_12 <- makeCorrAlpha(items, alpha, variance)
```


#### test output

```{r fig8, fig.height=4, fig.width=5, fig.align='center', echo = TRUE}

 alpha(cor_matrix_12)

 eigenvalues(cor_matrix_12, 1)
```



## Generate a dataframe of rating scales from a correlation matrix and predefined moments

### makeItems()

**_makeItems()_** generates a dataframe of random discrete
values from a _scaled Beta distribution_ so the data replicate a rating
scale, and are correlated close to a predefined correlation matrix. 

Generally, means, standard deviations, and correlations are correct to 
two decimal places.

_makeItems()_ is a wrapper function for 

 * _lfast_R()_, which takes repeated samples selecting a vector that
 best fits the desired moments, and
 
 * _lcor_C()_, which rearranges values in each column of the dataframe
 so they closely match the desired correlation matrix.
 

To create the desired dataframe, the user must define the 
following parameters:

- **_n_**: number of observations 

- **_lowerbound_**: a vector of length 'k' of values for the lower bound 
 of each variable (For example, '1' for a 1-5 rating scale)

- **_upperbound_**: a vector of length 'k' of values for the upper bound 
 of each variable (For example, '5' for a 1-5 rating scale)

- **_dfMeans_**: a vector of length 'k' of desired means of each variable

- **_dfSds_**: a vector of length 'k' of desired standard deviations of 
 each variable
 
- **_cormatrix_**: a target correlation matrix with 'k' rows and 'k' columns. 


### _makeItems()_ examples

```{r}

## define parameters

 n <- 128

 lowerbound <- rep(1, 4)
 upperbound <- rep(5, 4)
 
 dfMeans <- c(2.5, 3.0, 3.0, 3.5)
 dfSds <- c(1.0, 1.0, 1.5, 0.75)

 corMat <- matrix(
 c(
 1.00, 0.25, 0.35, 0.40,
 0.25, 1.00, 0.70, 0.75,
 0.35, 0.70, 1.00, 0.80,
 0.40, 0.75, 0.80, 1.00
 ),
 nrow = 4, ncol = 4
 )

## apply makeItems() function

 df <- makeItems(
 n = n, 
 lowerbound = lowerbound, 
 upperbound = upperbound, 
 means = dfMeans, 
 sds = dfSds, 
 cormatrix = corMat
 )

## test the function

 head(df); tail(df)
 
 apply(df, 2, mean) |> round(3)
 
 apply(df, 2, sd) |> round(3)
 
 cor(df) |> round(3)
```


## Helper functions

_likertMakeR()_ includes two additional functions that may be of help 
 when examining parameters and output.

 * **_alpha()_** calculates Cronbach's Alpha from a given correlation 
 matrix or a given dataframe
 
 * **_eigenvalues()_** calculates eigenvalues of a correlation matrix, 
 a report on whether the correlation matrix is positive definite, and 
 produces an optional scree plot.

### alpha()

_alpha()_ accepts, as input, either a correlation matrix or a dataframe. 
If both are submitted, then the correlation matrix is used by default, 
with a message to that effect.

### alpha() examples

```{r}

## define parameters

### example data frame

 df <- data.frame(
 V1 = c(4, 2, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1),
 V2 = c(4, 1, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3),
 V3 = c(4, 1, 3, 5, 4, 1, 4, 2),
 V4 = c(4, 3, 4, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3)
 )

### example correlation matrix

 corMat <- matrix(
 c(
 1.00, 0.35, 0.45, 0.70,
 0.35, 1.00, 0.60, 0.55,
 0.45, 0.60, 1.00, 0.65,
 0.70, 0.55, 0.65, 1.00
 ),
 nrow = 4, ncol = 4
 )

## apply function examples

 alpha(cor_matrix = corMat)

 alpha( , df)

 alpha(corMat, df)
```



### eigenvalues()

_eigenvalues()_ calculates eigenvalues of a correlation
 matrix, reports on whether the matrix is positive-definite,
 and optionally produces a scree plot.

### eigenvalues() examples


```{r}

## define parameters

 correlationMatrix <- matrix(
 c(
 1.00, 0.25, 0.35, 0.40,
 0.25, 1.00, 0.70, 0.75,
 0.35, 0.70, 1.00, 0.80,
 0.40, 0.75, 0.80, 1.00
 ),
 nrow = 4, ncol = 4
 )


## apply function

 evals <- eigenvalues(cormatrix = correlationMatrix)
 
 print(evals)
```

##### eigenvalues() function with optional scree plot

```{r fig9, fig.height=4, fig.width=5, fig.align='center', echo = TRUE}

 evals <- eigenvalues(correlationMatrix, 1)
```

# Alternative methods & packages

_LikertMakeR_ is intended for synthesising & correlating 
rating-scale data with means, standard deviations, and 
correlations as close as possible to predefined parameters. 
If you don't need your data to be close to exact, then other 
options may be faster or more flexible. 

Different approaches include:

- sampling from a _truncated normal_ distribution
 
- sampling with a predetermined probability distribution
 
- marginal model specification
 

### sampling from a _truncated normal_ distribution 

Data are sampled from a normal distribution, and then truncated to suit 
the rating-scale boundaries, and rounded to set discrete values as we see 
in rating scales. 

See [Heiz (2021)](https://glaswasser.github.io/simulating-correlated-likert-scale-data/) 
for an excellent and short example using the following packages:

- [truncnorm](https://cran.r-project.org/package=truncnorm)
 
- [faux](https://cran.r-project.org/package=faux) 
 
- See also the _rLikert()_ function from the 
 [responsesR](https://github.com/markolalovic/responsesR) package, 
 [Lalovic (2021)](https://github.com/markolalovic/responsesR), for an 
 approach using optimal discretization and skew-normal distribution.
 
### sampling with a predetermined probability distribution

- the following code will generate a vector of values with approximately 
 the given probabilities. 
 Good for simulating a single item.
 
```{r, eval = FALSE}

 n <- 128
 sample(1:5, n, replace = TRUE,
 prob = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1)
 )
```


### marginal model specification 

Marginal model specification extends the idea of a predefined probability 
distribution to multivariate and correlated data-frames.
