lcor() code analysis

There are a few ways to potentially make this code more efficient:

The first thing to note is that the outer for loop iterates over all rows of the 'ye' dataframe, which is an expanded grid of all possible pairs of rows. But inside the loop, the function only swaps elements in the same row. Therefore you can avoid expanding the grid entirely and just iterate over all the rows of the dataframe, this will save the time spent creating 'ye' and the time spent iterating over it.

When the function looks for a pair of values to swap in a column, it uses a nested for loop to iterate over all the rows, it could be more efficient to use sample function to select two random rows of a column

You are recalculating the correlation matrix inside the loops, this is an expensive operation. Instead, you can use the matrix operation to update the correlation matrix using the current pair of elements you're swapping, this will be much faster than recalculating the whole matrix every time.

After switching the values, you are checking if the absolute difference between the correlation matrices has decreased, to do that you're summing the absolute differences with sum((abs(target_cor - cor(current_dat))) * multiplier). But since you're only swapping two values, it's probably quicker to check if the correlation between the two columns the values belong to has improved.

Overall, the code can be made significantly more efficient by removing unnecessary calculations and loops, and finding more efficient ways to perform the necessary calculations.





The code currently performs a nested loop for swapping values in the data set and re-calculating the correlation matrix. This can be quite slow for large data sets. One option to speed this up would be to use a more efficient algorithm for finding the optimal swaps. For example, a simulated annealing or a genetic algorithm approach could be used to explore the space of possible swaps more efficiently.

The current implementation uses a "brute force" approach to search for the optimal swap: it considers all possible pairs of rows and performs the swap and correlation matrix calculation for each one. A more efficient method would be use techniques like random sampling or pairwise selection to decrease the number of swaps to test

You can also use matrix operations like the caret package to perform the correlation calculation faster.

As the matrix is symmetric (cor(A)=cor(A')), it might be useful to calculate only one half of the matrix and copy the values of the other half.

It also seems like you are using the "diff.score" variable only to record the current difference between correlation matrices and nothing else, this step is unnecessary, you could calculate the diff score on the fly.

It's worth noting that the above suggestions are based on general assumptions of the algorithm. The exact performance gains that can be achieved will depend on the specifics of the data and the problem being solved. In order to find the best optimization method for your case, it is best to try different methods and compare the results.

There are a few things that could be done to make this code more efficient:

The DEoptim function is already relatively efficient as it uses a differential evolution algorithm to optimize the function, which can be a good choice when the function is non-differentiable or noisy. If this is not the case and the function is smooth and well-behaved, it is recommended to use a more efficient optimization method.

It seems like the trace parameter is set to FALSE, so the optimization process is not providing detailed information about the progress, this can be helpful to understand the optimization process, it can help you to adjust the control parameters.

Also, the parallelType is set to "none" which means that the optimization is running serially. However, if your machine has multiple cores, you could set parallelType = "multicore" to use multiple cores in parallel and speed up the optimization process.

Make sure that your function fnmap_f is efficient, especially if it is called many times.

Also, you are dividing the my_best[["optim"]][["bestmem"]] by "items" and then removing the row names, it might not be necessary.

It's worth noting that these suggestions are based on general assumptions of the optimization problem being solved and the function being optimized. The exact performance gains that can be achieved will depend on the specifics of the problem and data. It's always worth testing multiple methods and comparing their performance to determine the best approach for a specific problem.


2 / 2

Here are a few suggestions that may help improve the performance of the code:

If the function DEoptim() is taking a long time to run, you may want to increase the itermax parameter, which controls the maximum number of iterations. However, be aware that increasing the number of iterations will also increase the computation time.

The strategy parameter controls the type of mutation used in the optimization process. Different strategies may have different performance characteristics, so you may want to experiment with different values to see if one is faster than the others.

The parallelType parameter controls whether parallel processing is used during the optimization process. If your machine has multiple cores, you could try setting this parameter to "multicore" or "snow" to take advantage of them.

The VTR is the termination criterion for the optimization, it is stopping criteria for the optimization.

If you can afford it, consider increasing the memory available for your R session to reduce the risk of memory issues.

You can also try using more optimized packages like optim, optimx, or ucminf to perform the optimization.

It's important to note that the specific performance gains that can be achieved will depend on the specifics of the problem being solved and the data, so testing out different parameters and optimization methods will be the best way to figure out what works best for your use case.

3 / 3

Here are a few ways to make the code more efficient:

The parallelType option in the DEoptim.control function is set to "none", which disables parallel processing. If you are running the code on a machine with multiple cores, you can set this option to "multicore" or "snow" to take advantage of parallel processing and speed up the optimization.

The itermax parameter in the DEoptim.control function sets the maximum number of iterations of the optimization algorithm. This can be increased to allow the optimization to run for more iterations and potentially find a better solution. However, keep in mind that increasing this value will also increase the computation time.

If you are using a large number of variables, you may consider to use the strategy for large scale optimization like "DIRECT" or "COBYLA" instead of the default one which could be less efficient for high dimensional optimization.

You can also consider other optimization algorithms as DE might not be the best for your problem or data. You can try packages like optimx, nloptr, or bobyqa.

You can also try using a built-in optimization functions in R like optimize() or nlm() that might be faster than DEoptim.

As with the previous example, the performance improvements will depend on the specifics of your problem and data, you might need to experiment to find the most efficient option.



lfast() code analysis

Here are a few suggestions for improving the efficiency of the code:

You can use ifelse() function instead of an if statement and else statement to improve the code readability
Instead of generating a warning message for every iteration of large standard deviation values, you can check the condition once and assign it to a variable or flag and use it to terminate the function if standard deviation value is not feasible
The if(missing(seed)) block seems to be redundant and can be removed, since it does not perform any actions and set.seed function doesn't need to be called with any value.
There is no need to round the final data to a certain number of decimal places before returning it, and it will save time to remove this step.
Also, you can consider the following points:

if your n is huge you should use rbeta(n, a, b,sim=TRUE) function instead of the default one, it is faster
If your lowerbound and upperbound values are fixed, you can precompute the range,mean and sd values before entering the function, it would save some time.
Keep in mind that the exact performance gains that can be achieved will depend on the specifics of the data and the problem being solved. It is best to test your code with different values for n and sd to evaluate the effectiveness of the above optimizations.

Here are a few suggestions for improving the efficiency of the code:

You can precompute the min, max, and mean values before entering the function, since they are derived from fixed values, it would save some time.
Like the previous examples, if your input n is large, you might want to use parallelType = "multicore" or parallelType = "snow" to take advantage of parallel processing and speed up the optimization.
If your lowerbound and upperbound values are fixed, you can precompute the range value before entering the function, it would save some time.
You can consider the number of iterations in the DEoptim.control function, and the n * 10 might be too low for large datasets and make the results inacurate, you may want to experiment with different values of itermax to find the optimal value.
Like the previous example, you can consider using other optimization algorithms like optimx, nloptr, or bobyqa instead of DEoptim
It's also worth noting that the target statistic defined in opt_scale function might not be the best choice for your problem, and you may want to experiment with different values to find the optimal solution.
